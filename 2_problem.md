# Problem
We just created a Rack Middleware that automatically converts JSON keys in the request params to snakecase and response body to camelcase.

How would we use this in a Rails app?

# Hint
1. [Configuring Middleware in your Rails app](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_on_rack.html#configuring-middleware-stack)
2. [Using a Railtie to automate the middleware configuration](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Rails/Railtie.html)
